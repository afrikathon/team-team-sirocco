## Talent Ocean

Exposing African Talents (Developers,Project Managers,QA, etc) to the global market.


## About

We aim to eliminate the long recruitment process and cut down recruitment time by 1000%. We are providing a platform where recruiters have easy, fast and efficient access to the best talents ranked to meet their needs. The platform works with talents to provide a system of ranking them based on talent details (including links to other sites related to talent's career e.g GitHub, dribble) provided and vetted through various means like talent to talent review, challenges to vet their skills, et.c.

## Why

We realized that recruiters spend a lot of valuable time to vet talents and ascertain their competencies. And that most talents are not sure what level they are skill-wise or the path to take to get to the next level. When do I know if Iâ€™m a mid-level developer? What steps can I take to level up?. We saw that talents do not earn up to their pairs with the same skill level in global markets. We saw talents do not grow their skills level actively.

## Usage
